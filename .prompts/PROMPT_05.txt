Implement full sync pipeline.

Steps:
1. Create FetchRun row.
2. Iterate enabled sources.
3. Fetch listing pages.
4. Store raw artifacts.
5. Parse into OpportunityDraft.
6. Normalize canonical_key.
7. Deduplicate.
8. Enrich.
9. Upsert + version tracking.
10. Produce run summary.

Write outputs:
reports/<run_id>/daily_brief.md
reports/<run_id>/opportunities_delta.json

Scheduler:
- tokio-cron-scheduler
- Cron expressions from config
- Controlled by RHOF_SCHEDULER_ENABLED

Ensure idempotency.

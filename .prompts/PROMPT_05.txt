Implement full sync pipeline.

Scope note:
- In this prompt, implement the end-to-end pipeline orchestration and integration points.
- Wire dedup + enrichment as explicit stages/interfaces, but complete the dedup/rules engine behavior in PROMPT_06.

Steps:
1. Create FetchRun row.
2. Iterate enabled sources.
3. Fetch listing pages.
4. Store raw artifacts.
5. Parse into OpportunityDraft.
6. Normalize canonical_key.
7. Deduplicate.
8. Enrich.
9. Upsert + version tracking.
10. Produce run summary.

Use the shared `OpportunityDraft` contract from `rhof-core` for adapter parse output.
Read enabled sources from `sources.yaml` using the schema defined in PROMPT_01.

Write outputs:
reports/<run_id>/daily_brief.md
reports/<run_id>/opportunities_delta.json

Scheduler:
- tokio-cron-scheduler
- Cron expressions from config
- Controlled by RHOF_SCHEDULER_ENABLED

Ensure idempotency.

Outputs / Verification:
- A runnable sync command/path executes the staged pipeline end-to-end
- Dedup/enrichment hooks are present and invoked (full rules/dedup logic lands in PROMPT_06)

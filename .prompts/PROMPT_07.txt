After each run:
- Export Parquet for:
    opportunities
    opportunity_versions
    tags
    sources
- Write manifest.json with schema_version + file hashes.

Implement CLI:
rhof report daily --runs N

This prompt introduces the `report` subcommand in the shared CLI; PROMPT_09 extends the same CLI with additional commands.

DuckDB integration optional but Parquet mandatory.

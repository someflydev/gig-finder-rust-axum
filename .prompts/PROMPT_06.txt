Implement dedup and rules engine.

Dedup:
- canonical_key normalization
- jaro-winkler similarity
- cluster confidence score
- review queue threshold

Rules:
- rules/tags.yaml
- rules/risk.yaml
- rules/pay.yaml

Rules must be data-driven, not hardcoded.

Tests required for:
- true match
- false positive
- borderline cluster

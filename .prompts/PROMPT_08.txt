Implement Axum web server.

Routes:
GET /
GET /opportunities
GET /opportunities/table
GET /opportunities/facets
GET /opportunities/:id
GET /sources
GET /review
POST /review/:id/resolve
GET /reports
GET /reports/chart

Use Askama templates.
Serve assets/static/app.css.
HTMX for filtering + pagination.
Plotly JSON returned by backend.

Web port = RHOF_WEB_PORT (default 8000).

Add handler smoke tests.

Outputs / Verification:
- Routes render successfully with Askama templates and serve `assets/static/app.css`
- HTMX partial routes (`/opportunities/table`, `/opportunities/facets`) return partial-friendly HTML responses
- `/reports/chart` returns backend-generated Plotly JSON payload
- Handler smoke tests cover route registration + representative success paths

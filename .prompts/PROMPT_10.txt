Design and implement a scalable adapter expansion framework.

Goal:
Allow adding new source adapters with high rigor and low regression risk.

Requirements:

1. Adapter template generator:
   - Provide a `rhof-cli new-adapter <source_id>` command
   - Generates:
       - adapter skeleton file
       - fixtures directory
       - test skeleton
       - documentation stub in docs/SOURCES.md

2. Enforce adapter contract:
   - Must define crawlability
   - Must provide at least one fixture
   - Must pass snapshot parsing test
   - Must include extractor_version string

3. Implement full adapter for each additional source:
   Implement all sources listed in `sources.yaml`, in chunks of 3-5 sources per iteration.
   Use the `sources.yaml` schema defined in PROMPT_01 to drive chunk planning and status tracking.
   For each source added:
   - Add fixture HTML
   - Implement parsing
   - Add tests
   - Ensure evidence coverage ≥ 90% of extracted fields

   Execution guidance:
   - After each chunk, run tests and fix regressions before starting the next chunk
   - After chunk 1, require one successful end-to-end local sync + report generation + web smoke test before continuing to chunk 2+
   - If a source is gated/manual-only, implement the manual ingestion path and fixtures instead of login-based scraping
   - Document deferred/blocked sources in docs/SOURCES.md only if they are not publicly crawlable without violating rules

4. Provide Adapter Quality Checklist in docs:
   - ToS-safe?
   - No login?
   - Evidence coverage?
   - Rate limits respected?
   - Manual fallback if gated?
   - Parsing tests included?

5. Add CI rule:
   - Fail build if new adapter has no fixtures
   - Fail build if parse tests missing

   Extend the CI workflow introduced in PROMPT_09 (do not replace it).

6. Document expansion workflow in RUNBOOK.md:
   - Add to sources.yaml
   - Implement adapter
   - Add fixtures
   - Run tests
   - Review evidence coverage
   - Run sync locally

Deliver complete code for:
- new-adapter CLI generator
- template files
- CI enforcement logic (basic check script acceptable)

Outputs / Verification:
- Adapter generator command works for a sample source_id
- CI checks fail when fixture/test requirements are missing
- Chunked adapter expansion progresses with passing tests between chunks

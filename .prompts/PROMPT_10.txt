Design and implement a scalable adapter expansion framework.

Goal:
Allow adding new source adapters with high rigor and low regression risk.

Requirements:

1. Adapter template generator:
   - Provide a `rhof-cli new-adapter <source_id>` command
   - Generates:
       - adapter skeleton file
       - fixtures directory
       - test skeleton
       - documentation stub in docs/SOURCES.md

2. Enforce adapter contract:
   - Must define crawlability
   - Must provide at least one fixture
   - Must pass snapshot parsing test
   - Must include extractor_version string

3. Implement full adapter for each additional source:
   For each source added:
   - Add fixture HTML
   - Implement parsing
   - Add tests
   - Ensure evidence coverage ≥ 90% of extracted fields

4. Provide Adapter Quality Checklist in docs:
   - ToS-safe?
   - No login?
   - Evidence coverage?
   - Rate limits respected?
   - Manual fallback if gated?
   - Parsing tests included?

5. Add CI rule:
   - Fail build if new adapter has no fixtures
   - Fail build if parse tests missing

6. Document expansion workflow in RUNBOOK.md:
   - Add to sources.yaml
   - Implement adapter
   - Add fixtures
   - Run tests
   - Review evidence coverage
   - Run sync locally

Deliver complete code for:
- new-adapter CLI generator
- template files
- CI enforcement logic (basic check script acceptable)

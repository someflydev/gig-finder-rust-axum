Implement:

CLI commands:
- sync
- serve
- report
- seed
- debug

Extend the existing CLI introduced earlier (including `report` from PROMPT_07); do not reimplement a separate command tree.

`seed` command behavior:
- Seed data storage from checked-in fixture-derived data (raw artifacts + parsed records)
- Prefer accurate fixture-derived data over synthetic demo rows
- Keep seed inputs deterministic and documented
- Reuse the unified fixture bundle format defined in PROMPT_04 (do not create a second seed-only schema)
- Seed should import raw artifacts + parsed records in a way that preserves provenance/evidence linkage
- Seed import must be idempotent using content hashes + stable keys (re-running seed should not duplicate artifacts/opportunities)

GitHub Actions:
- fmt
- clippy (deny warnings)
- test

Guardrails:
- Adapter checklist doc
- Runtime warning if evidence missing
- UI badge for manual/gated sources

Ensure:
- just dev works
- DB on 5401
- No default ports anywhere
